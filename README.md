# MalariaDetector: Advanced CNN-based Malaria Detection with Virus Positioning for Severity Assessment

## Overview
MalariaDetector is an advanced deep learning project leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect malaria from microscopic images. This tool not only identifies the presence of malaria parasites but also pinpoints their positions within the cell, providing critical information for assessing the severity of the infection.

## Key Features

### 1. Malaria Detection
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art CNN architectures to achieve high accuracy in detecting malaria parasites in blood smear images.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of processing and analyzing images in real-time, making it suitable for use in clinical settings.

### 2. Virus Positioning
- **Precise Localization**: Identifies and highlights the exact positions of malaria parasites within the cell, providing valuable insights for medical professionals.
- **Severity Assessment**: Based on the number and location of parasites, the system offers an estimation of infection severity, aiding in timely and appropriate treatment decisions.

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays detection results with clear markers indicating the positions of the parasites.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive reports with infection severity scores and visual evidence of parasite locations.

### 4. Scalability and Integration
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large volumes of images, suitable for deployment in both small clinics and large hospitals.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated with existing medical imaging systems and electronic health records (EHR) for streamlined workflows.

## Installation
